Note for Linux distribution maintainers:

These manpages contain polish diacritical marks (8bit characters); do not 
forget to change all calls to `groff -Tascii' to `groff -Tlatin1' in
/etc/man.config. Besides, it is often desirable to set the environment
variable LESSCHARSET to latin1 (if you use less as the manpager).
